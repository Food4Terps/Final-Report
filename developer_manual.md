# Developer's Manual

The first step to consider to work on this application is to brainstorm what technology the team should use in order to complete the website. We focused to use the text editor called Atom in order to write our application because it is the most familiar with from previous assignments and projects from the past.

For this project, we used the w3.css framework

There are some changes that were made based on the libraries and file structures. In the proposal, the team said that we are going to have seperate files for each language and libraries such as HTML, PHP, MySQL, Javascript and CSS. Unfortunately we did not commit to this plan but instead decided to have embed everything into one file to avoid confusion and avoid losing files. Additionally, we decided to include mysql/MyPhpAdmin into our project because we are dealing with individuals who are going to need sign in with their account information.

To have all scripts, libraries, etc working, the developer would need to use either Apache or ampps in order to have the php, and mysql working. If these are not downloaded by the developer, he or she would not be able to control the servers for php, mysql, and would not be able to edit configurations files depending on the servers that are being used.

The files of code for the application was copied from the local host to the remote server, which in this instance was Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are a number of reasons why the use of AWS was implemented, including increased elasticity, massive scalability, storage, and enhanced security through the implementation of various security protocols such as data encryption and firewalls. An account was created in order to create an instance within a security group, which provided the IP address along with the URL of the server. 

With the use of Terminal, the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) was used to establish the connection with Ubuntu by referencing the key pair that was downloaded from the used instance. A LAMP web server was then established (L = Linux as the operating system platform, A = Apache as the Web Server, M = MySQL as the database server, P = PHP as the supportive language). This required the installation and configuration of Apache web server, MySQL database server, and PHP components. Several packages had to be installed in order to accomplish this, such as Mysql-server, Mysql-client, Phpmyadmin, and php-mbstring. After this was done, the Apache web server was then connected to MySQL server. This required a list of configurations within MySQL in the directory /var/www/html. Ultimately, the file of code of the running application was copied into this server by using the SCP secure copy protocol from the terminal. This allows the application to be running on the URL of the AWS server.
